			<p><strong>Q: Who   will be my Disc Jockey?</strong></p>

			<p><strong>Q: Should we include you in our count for lunch/dinner?</strong></p>

					be happy to stay. But, If you are having an afternoon event, 
					Keith suggests that you schedule enough time when you   sign our contract. He may have an evening event scheduled, and we would hate to   end your event prematurely.</p>
